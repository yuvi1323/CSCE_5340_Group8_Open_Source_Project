This proposal outlines the development of a Python-based, open-source package designed to
simplify two critical tasks for data professionals: (1) retrieving and visualizing real-time news
articles, and (2) generating customizable random datasets for testing, data analysis, and
visualization projects.
The key problems this package aims to solve are the manual and time-consuming processes of
collecting data from news sources and generating synthetic data for testing purposes. These
processes are crucial for developers, data scientists, and analysts who need data for visualizations,
machine learning models, and real-time decision-making.
The project is estimated to cost $50,000 and will take 3 months to complete. This cost covers the
efforts of a development team, testing, documentation, and deployment to both GitHub and the
Python Package Index (PyPI). The deliverables include a fully functional Python package,
complete with extensive documentation, ready for use by the developer community.

**Project Description:** Overview of the Open-Source Project
The proposed Python package will leverage existing open-source libraries such as requests,
wordcloud, and matplotlib. It will offer two primary functionalities:
**1. News Article Retrieval and Visualization: **The package will interface with NewsAPI,
allowing users to retrieve news articles on specific topics in real-time. The data will be
saved in CSV format and visualized using word clouds, giving users a quick and interactive
way to analyze the information.
**2. Random Data Generator for Visualization Projects: **This feature will enable users to
generate synthetic datasets tailored to their requirements, which can be used in data
visualization and testing projects. The generated data will be highly customizable, making
it suitable for a variety of use cases.

Context for the Extension
There is a growing need for tools that streamline the retrieval of real-time data and generate mock
datasets for testing and visualization. Many developers and data scientists spend significant
amounts of time collecting data manually or building synthetic datasets from scratch.
With the explosion of data-driven decision-making, the ability to efficiently gather and visualize
data is crucial. This package will be valuable to:
• Data Scientists: for creating datasets to test models or retrieve news articles for sentiment
analysis.
• Developers: for quickly generating random data for use in demos and visualizations.
• Academics and Researchers: for analyzing real-world news trends and generating mock
data for research papers.
Goal of the Extension
The primary goal is to create an intuitive, powerful, and user-friendly Python package that:
1. Automates real-time news article retrieval: The package will allow users to retrieve
news articles by topic or keyword in real-time using the NewsAPI.
2. Visualizes data: The package will provide features to visualize the retrieved news data in
the form of word clouds, making it easier to identify key trends and terms.
3. Generates synthetic datasets: Users will be able to generate random datasets for use in
testing and data visualization projects. This feature will be highly customizable, allowing
users to define the type, range, and size of the data they need.
